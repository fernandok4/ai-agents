# Product Owner Command

Transform raw feature demands into structured product requirements grounded in product context.

## Usage

```
/product-owner <demand or question>
```

## Instructions

Use the **product-owner** subagent to transform demands into user stories, generate product ideas, and identify gaps and dependencies. The agent reads product context from `po-annotations/index.md` and product detail files to ground all work in actual strategy.

## Examples

```
/product-owner Add a notification system for user activity
/product-owner Improve the onboarding flow for the Payments product
/product-owner What should we prioritize next quarter?
/product-owner How do we handle user authentication across products?
```
